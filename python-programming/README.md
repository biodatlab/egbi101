# Introduction to Python Programming

Python is a popular programming language in biomedical engineering and data science.
In this class, we'll use Google Colab, a free cloud-based platform that allows you to:

- Write and execute Python code in your web browser without any installation requires
- Access powerful computing resources including GPUs
- Share and collaborate on notebooks
- Save your work directly to Google Drive
- Import and export notebooks easily

# 
You can try running this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/wieheistdu/egbi101/blob/main/python-programming/introduction_to_python.ipynb) and clicking the "Open in Colab" button to open it in the Colabolaratory notebook. This notebook provides fundamental details of Python programming along with hands-on biomedical-related exercises to enhance your skills. The topics covered include:

- Variables and Built-in Functions
- Strings
- Lists
- Tuples and Sets
- Dictionaries
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Functions
- Some extra-questions to strengthen your Python basic skill!

Some contents and exercises are adapted from [30-Days-Of-Python](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python/tree/master).
