# Microcontroller and Arduino

This class is designed to be used with both real hardware and an online simulator. The online simulator (Tinkercad.com) provides an easy and accessible way to test and debug circuits without requiring physical components. This makes the course inclusive for all students, even those without access to an Arduino board. It also offers a safer environment for beginners to explore microcontroller programming—especially in the early lessons, where trial and error is a big part of the learning process.

## What you’ll learn

- The concept and history of microcontrollers, and their role in embedded systems
- How to choose the right microcontroller for a project based on purpose and limitations
- Why Arduino is widely used in education, prototyping, and biomedical applications
- Key microcontroller concepts through hands-on practice using both real hardware and an online simulator

## Hands-on Components (Real board + Online simulator)

### Digital Output

- Turn an LED on and off using digital pins
- Understand HIGH/LOW signals and control flow

### Bits, Bytes, and PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)

- Learn about binary data, how bits and bytes work
- Use PWM to control brightness of LED

### Serial Monitor Communication

- Display values from sensors or debugging messages
- Understand real-time communication between board and computer

### Digital Input

- Read button/switch inputs
- Create responsive interactions using input data

### Analog Input & ADC (Analog-to-Digital Conversion)

- Read data from sensors like potentiometers or temperature sensors
- Learn how analog signals are converted into digital values

### If-Condition and Application Logic

- Use conditional logic to make decisions in your code
- Combine inputs and outputs to create simple functional systems (e.g., auto light, basic alert system)
